## Title:
HELP-RL: Real-Time Policy Optimization with New Hierarchical Decoder for Heterogeneous and Stochastic Disaster Response Logistics

## Abstract:

Disaster response logistics plays a vital role in relief operations by ensuring that essential resources reach affected communities
promptly during emergencies. Although its significance is widely recognized, existing studies tend to focus primarily on pre-disaster
planning, leaving notable gaps in addressing the complex, dynamic, and unpredictable challenges of real-time disaster response.
This paper introduces a new framework called HELP-RL (Humanitarian Emergency Logistics Planning with Reinforcement
Learning) to address these challenges, which are grouped into three main categories: heterogynous fleet types, diverse demand
types, and stochastic travel times. Together, these reflect the real-world complexities of disaster response logistics, all of which
require real-time management. The HELP-RL framework incorporates a unique hierarchical decoder to manage the intricate
action space, paired with an efficiently designed attention-based policy optimizer using the REINFORCE algorithm. This fully
integrated model is built to adapt dynamically to changing disaster conditions, providing reliable and real-time solutions. To assess
its performance, we tested the framework using both synthetic and real-world data from wildfire response logistics, drawing on
actual data to replicate realistic scenarios. The findings show that HELP-RL produces adaptable and optimal policies that effectively
handle rapid changes, surpassing other reinforcement learning approaches in terms of both efficiency and practical applicability.
